  <div class="question">There are many language learning apps, how is this app different?</div>
  <p class="answer">The DakelhLingo app strives to provide an immersive experience into the Dakelh language. It does
    not teach how to translate from English to Dakelh. It attempts to teach the language and the culture by image
    association and thought patterns
  </p>
  <p class="answer">The app takes the position of Dakelh first, English second. Meaning, All menus, categories, etc
    within the app are built first with Dakelh, then the English text is translated from the Dakelh meaning. The user is
    fully immersed into an experience based on the Dakelh way of thinking.
